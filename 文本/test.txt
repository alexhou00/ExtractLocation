It was a hot summer day, there was a marathon took taken place in the center of a bustling city, all runners tried their best to control their breath, hoping to finish the race as fast as they could. What a hot day! One of the runners thought. They were soaked in not only sweat but also cheers of the crowds, with their determination fueling their every step. Along the road, people gather behind the fences, cheering for the runners. Especially there were a few popular athletes, who were expected to win the race, the crowds kept cheering for them. Oakley, a student who is totally a beginner, also joined the marathon. After months of practicing, he thought it’s time he could go run a real full marathon on his own, so he signed up for the race, willing to finish the whole route.

As the marathon continued, Oakley had got the tempo and rhythm. All of a sudden, with some sort of confidence, he pushed himself to the limit, his breath became smoother, his pace became more consistent. The crowds had let out an excited scream, just in a few minutes, Oakley even ran passed the athletes one by one! With his powerful and steady steps, nobody wasn’t surprised by his speed. Being the leading one, just as he ran passed the finish line, the crowds heated up, they went crazy and shouted excitedly! Finally, he claimed not only the first place but also the big prize, and all his hard work had just paid off. After that, he was considered a legend in the marathon community, and many find him successful. What we can learn from Oakley’s story is that, one day one may succeed by putting efforts into something. As the saying goes, “No pain, no gain”, you may reach your goals as long as you work harder.
